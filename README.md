# Flight Predictions

**Project Description: Airline Data Analysis for Operational and Pricing Insights**

**Objective:**
The goal of this data science project is to analyze a comprehensive dataset of airline information to derive meaningful insights related to flight schedules, pricing, and airline preferences. The project will involve thorough data cleaning, preparation, and exploratory data analysis to answer key questions regarding the timing of flights, the impact of duration on ticket prices, the preferred routes for Jet Airways, and a broader analysis of the relationship between different airlines and their corresponding ticket prices.

**Deliverables:**
   - Cleaned and prepared dataset.
   - Visualizations and summary statistics for the timing of flights.
   - Insights into the impact of flight duration on ticket prices.
   - Identification of Jet Airways' most used route(s).
   - Comprehensive analysis of the relationship between different airlines and ticket prices.

**Tools and Technologies:**
   - Python for data cleaning, preparation, and analysis.
   - Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib/Seaborn for data manipulation and visualization.
   - Jupyter Notebooks for documentation and presentation of findings.

**Expected Outcomes:**
The project aims to provide actionable insights for airline operators, travelers, and industry analysts. The findings can be used to optimize flight schedules, refine pricing strategies, and enhance overall operational efficiency.
